# Fibonacci Series

A simple C++ program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

## How It Works

- The program starts the sequence from 1.
- Each number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers.
- The number of terms to print is specified in the function call (`PrintFibonacciSeries(10)` prints 11 terms including the first 1).

## How to Run

1. Download the code.
2. Open it with any C++ editor.
3. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o fibonacci
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   ./fibonacci
   ```

## Example Output

```
1	1	2	3	5	8	13	21	34	55	89	
```
